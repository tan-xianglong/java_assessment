# Java Assessment - Course and Student Management Program
## What did you like about this project?

I'm glad that I made the decision to store the student's enrolled course information as Hashmap instead of ArrayList so that the grades can be assigned to the respective courses. 

New methods are created to refactor certain task to keep the codes clean.

I have input extra input validation for the grading functionality.

## What did you struggle with in this project?

This project challenges my understanding of many Java concepts such as composition, exception handling, inheritence, object oriented approach. I'm happy that I was able to pick up the new language within 2 weeks and gain basic understanding and complete the assessment.


## What would make your experience with this assessment better?

The assessment duration was good and the initial set up was helpful.
